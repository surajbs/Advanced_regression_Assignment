# Advanced House Price Regression
Housing_price_Prediction
In this assignment we need to build a model for the prediction of demand for housing price as per the market standards.

## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

Business Goal
It is required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Steps followed for Model Prediction
Reading, understanding and visualizing the data
Preparing the data for modelling
Training the model
Residual Analysis
Prediction and evaluation on the Test set based on Ridge and Lasso Regression Techniques
Conclusion
Lasso Regression model was chosen finally, since it makes the insignificant features for the prediction to zero value.
